  <h2 style="text-align: justify;">To my dear Bianca,</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   Congratulations on graduating high school! Despite evrything that happened, you managed. And I'm so proud of you doing it.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    I know you have been through a lot, and yet here you are ready to take on the next chapters of your life. You deserve every bit of good thing that's
     happening to you right now. As your bestfriend for 2 years, I have witnessed you grow into the woman that you are right now. And I have been so lucky
     because I'm one of the people who saw it.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">I have been lucky enough to see someone like you succeed</p> 
  <p style="text-align: justify;">I also want to thank you for everything. Thank for being there when no one was. Thank you for being my friend.
    Thank you for being my smoke buddy. Thank you for everything. I would always cherish these memories as it would be a constant reminder
    that a part of my life was accompanied by a great woman.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">Speaking of memories, I would never forget everything that we've done together. From pen spinning tricks to solving cubes.
    Or every lunch break that instantly turns into a rant session. The sudden trips to buy snacks. Long audio calls while doing daily tasks. Rushing every
    project we have beacuse why not? And so many other things. Your company and care is highly appreciated, any guy or girl would be lucky enough to have you.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">Which brings me to my next point. Look for someone who truly loves you, oki? Trust me, it's better to be loved than to be in love.
    look for someone who loves you even in your dark days. The kind of love that wouldn't ask for more. The kind of love that feels natural, like loving you  is their way of breathing.
    It may seem impossible right now, but trust me, it will happen. Despite how chaotic you are, you're not hard to love. Everything I told you when we were tipsy
    was true.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Hindi ka mahirap mahalin, Binaca</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You're bubbly personality along with how strong you are as a person makes you a loveable human being. And I know that because
        for the past 2 years, you have showed me the deeper sides of you that you don't normally share to others.
        With those observations, I can confidently say that you are not just a human being. 
        <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">You are a melody that only quality musicians undertand.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">If someone tells otherwise I would personally argue with them.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> I really don't have much to tell you, I know dee down we'll still talk, not just on a regular basis.
            but just know, that if you ever need a friend to tell how your day went, or if everything feels heavy, or even if the world is against you, 
            I'm one call away oki?
  <h5 style=" text-align: right;">From one of your bff, Rein</h5>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">P.S: I made this pink af because it's your favorite color.</p>
